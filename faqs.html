		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

		<h2><span class="question">Q:</span> I think I have a virus. What should I do?</h2>
		<p><span class="answer">A:</span> If you think your computer is behaving strangely and may be infected, note down what the behaviour is and when it started.</p>	
		<p>Disconnect the network cable or wireless connection from the computer to isolate the problem and <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> immediately so we can investigate and determine the cause.</p>

		<h2><span class="question">Q:</span> What do people mean by "the cloud"? </h2>
		<p><span class="answer">A:</span> When people talk about the cloud, they are commonly referring to servers on the internet which store their information.</p>
		<p>Servers in the cloud mainly operate in clusters so that if one individual server has a problem, none of your information is lost.</p>
		<p>Services such as Office 365, Google Apps and Dropbox all operate on a cloud platform so that you can access your information anywhere you have the internet and not have to worry about it disappearing.</p>

		<h2><span class="question">Q:</span> Can you help me with my smartphone setup?</h2>
		<p><span class="answer">A:</span> Yes, we can help you setup your email accounts, cloud storage and synchronisation on your smartphone.</p>
		<p>If you're changing from one phone to another, not a problem, we can move your information from your old phone to your new one.</p>
		<p>How can I see my calendars on my phone and computer at the same time? </p>

		<h2><span class="question">Q:</span> How can I see my calendars on my phone and computer at the same time? </h2>
		<p><span class="answer">A:</span> If you have an email account through Office 365, Google or a number of other providers, your calendar can synchronise between your devices so you always know when your next appointment will be.</p>
		<p>Don't have an email account with one of those or providers or are unsure? <a href="contact.html">Give us a call</a> and we'd be happy to talk to you about it.</p>

		<h2><span class="question">Q:</span> What is VOIP? Why do I need it for phone calls? </h2>
		<p><span class="answer">A:</span> VOIP stands for Voice Over Internet Protocol and is a mechanism for voice calls to be made over the internet.</p>
		<p>VOIP generally offers much cheaper call costs than traditional phone calls but requires an active internet connection.</p>
		<p>To make use of VOIP for phone calls you will need specific software on a computer, a VOIP enabled phone or a VOIP adaptor (which connects a traditional phone to a VOIP service).</p>
		<p>Your VOIP service provider will connect your calls to traditional numbers so you can still call anyone you want. Over the next 10 years fixed line phone services in Australia will transition to VOIP, if you'd like to know more about the benefits to you and how to change over, just <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
